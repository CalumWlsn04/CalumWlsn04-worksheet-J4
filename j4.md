1) Consider the class declaration below:
```java
// Is this possible?
public class Lion extends Mammal, Carnivore {
    // ...
}
```

- Explain why the following class declaration is not possible in Java.
- What are the limitations of the extends key word?
- How can you accomplish this inheritance structure task in Java?

The following class declaration is impossible because the core behind Java structures does not allow for extending multiple classes (as in a single class having multiple parent classes). Extend can only point a single super class, no more than 1. You can accomplish this inheritance structure by setting up an interface to allow for the implementation of many classes.

2) What are some of the functional differences between an abstract class and an interface? Use the example below to answer this question.

```java
public abstract class Employee {
    // ...
}

// vs.

public interface Employee {
    //...
}
```

In the employee class you can declare fields and you can flesh out the method bodies. The abstract class can look like a regular class. For the interface, the only thing you can do is to provide the method signatures.

3) Consider the interfaces for a Stack and Queue of ints.

```java
public interface Stack {
   public void push(int v);
   public int pop();
   public int peek();
}

public interface Queue {
   public void enqueue(int v);
   public int dequeue();
   public int peek();
}
```

Now suppose you had a LinkedList implementation to store ints with the following methods defined.

```java
public class LinkedList implements Stack, Queue {
  public LinkedList() {/*...*/}
  public void addToFront(int v) {/*...*/}
  public int rmFromFront() {/*...*/}
  public void addToBack(int v) {/*...*/}
  public void rmFromBack() {/*...*/}
  
  //FINISH HERE

  public void push(int v)
  {
    addToFront(v);
  }
  public int pop()
    return rmFromFront();

  public int peek()
  {
    int front = rmFromFront();
    addToFront(front);
    return front;
  }

  public void enqueue(int v)
  {
    addToFront(v);
  }

  public int dequeue()
  {
    rmFromBack();
  }
  
}
```

Using those methods in LinkedList complete the realization of a Stack and Queue:
